Due to technical issues, we have archived this project. You can download the first version from the "Public Release"; it should work perfectly, but it may not work locally unless hosted on a website.

The new code doesn't work properly and presents many problems, and Timezone Explorer isn't one of our "main projects," so we're not investing time in it.
